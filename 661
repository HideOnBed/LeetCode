I process all the eight edge conditions, causing the code to be very prolix;

The better way is to use an assistant method to process every cell uniformly; and in the method, we consider all the 8 surrounding cells only
if their positions do not exceed the boundary;

public int helper(int[][] M, int x, int y){
    int count = 0;
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i = -1; i < 2; i++){
        for(int j = -1; j < 2; j++){
            if(x+i >= 0 && x+i < M.length && y+j >= 0 && y+j < M[0].length){
                sum += M[x+i][y+j];
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return sum/count;
}
