find the day whose price is lower than the next day, and buy = prices[i], then find the day whose price is higher than the next day, 
then sell = prices[i]. and profit += sell-buy, continue;

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){
            while(i < prices.length-1 && prices[i+1] <= prices[i]){
                i++;
            }
            int buy = prices[i];
            while(i < prices.length-1 && prices[i+1] >= prices[i]){
                i++;
            }
            int sell = prices[i];
            profit += sell - buy;
        }
        return profit;
    }
}

Error in first time: add an unnecessary step: i++ after the first while loop; 

Better way found in second time:
Just let prices[i]-prices[i-1](i from 1 to prices.length), and add the result to profit if it is bigger than 0;
