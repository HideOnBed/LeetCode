One Integer can be got by multiplying two integers, and one of them must less than the square root of the integer 
and the other must greater than that or both of them equal to that. So to find the biggest smaller multiplier(cause the range is smaller) is 
one way to solve the problem.

Step 1: get the square root of area by using Math.sqrt(area);
Step 2ï¼›i start from sqrt to 0. if(area%i==0) them we get the smaller multiplier
